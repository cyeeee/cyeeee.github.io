										The objective of this project is to explore and convey the profound impact of music on people’s lives through WebVR storytelling. 
										I created an immersive, interactive experience that allows users to engage with the emotional and transformative aspects of music on Mozilla Hubs.
									</p>

									<p>The concept for my story would be Memory and Perception. The key theme I want to convey in my work is the special power of the music. 
										I want to express how music relates to our brain as it can trigger specific emotions and memories, as well as how music can help bring a sense of identity to people and connect people.</p>

									<p><b>Story:</b> A depressed person, who was trapped by inner loss, being animated and healed by music.</p>
									<p><b>Environment:</b> Enclosed spaces with spiral-shaped hallways mimic a maze, while outside the building is nature.</p>

										</div>
									</div>
									
									<p><b>Expected Experience:</b> The audience will play as the person in my narrative, start from the middle of the space, and have an immersive experience of going out of the building to nature.</p>
									<p><b>Music Selection:</b> I picked 5 songs by a Japanese artist, <a href="https://www.wakarenokana.com/">Kana Wakareno</a>. I occasionally heard her music and at first, I felt sad, but as I listened to it I calmed down and felt healed, so I thought her music would be a good fit for my story as it can evoke different emotions. </p>
									<p><b>Challenges:</b> I struggled with how to build a 3D environment for my story at first because I had no experience in designing and building environments and I was afraid that I couldn’t translate my ideas into something visible. I also struggled with how to let the audience know what I was trying to convey during the process. 
										I would like to leave some space for the audience to explore by themselves but don’t want them to get lost or confused. It was a little hard to find the balance between freedom and confusion, so I ended up adding some prompts and navigation in my world to help guide the audience through the story. </p>
